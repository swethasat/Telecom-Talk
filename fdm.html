Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) is a multiplexing technique used in telecommunications to combine multiple signals onto a single communication channel. It divides the available frequency range of the channel into separate frequency bands, with each signal assigned a distinct frequency band for transmission. FDM is commonly employed in radio and television broadcasting, as well as other communication systems.<br><br>

<h2>How FDM Works</h2><br>

In an FDM system, the available frequency spectrum of the communication channel is divided into multiple non-overlapping frequency bands. Each signal to be transmitted is assigned a specific frequency band within the spectrum. The signals are modulated onto carrier waves of different frequencies and transmitted simultaneously. The frequency bands are carefully separated to prevent interference between signals and allow them to coexist without mutual disruption.<br><br>

<h2>Applications of FDM</h2><br>

<b>1. Radio Broadcasting:</b> FDM is extensively used in radio broadcasting, where different radio stations transmit on separate frequencies within a shared frequency spectrum. Each radio station is allocated a specific frequency band for its signal transmission. This allows multiple radio stations to operate simultaneously without interfering with one another. Listeners can tune in to their desired station by selecting the corresponding frequency on their radios.<br><br>

<b>2. Television Broadcasting:</b> FDM is also employed in television broadcasting, particularly for over-the-air transmissions. Television channels are assigned specific frequency bands for their signals. Viewers tune their televisions to the appropriate frequency to receive the desired television channel. FDM enables multiple television channels to be transmitted concurrently without interference.<br><br>

<h2>Advantages of FDM</h2><br>

<b>Simultaneous Transmission:</b> FDM allows multiple signals to be transmitted simultaneously on different frequency bands within the same channel, enabling efficient utilization of the available frequency spectrum.<br><br>
<b>Interference Mitigation:</b> The separation of frequency bands minimizes interference between signals, ensuring the quality and integrity of each transmitted signal.<br><br>
<b>Compatibility:</b> FDM is compatible with existing communication systems and can be easily implemented without requiring significant changes to infrastructure.<br><br>
<h2>Limitations of FDM</h2><br>

<b>Fixed Bandwidth Allocation:</b> Each signal in an FDM system is assigned a fixed frequency band, regardless of the actual data rate or bandwidth requirements. This can result in inefficient utilization of frequency spectrum if some frequency bands are underutilized.<br><br>
<b>Limited Flexibility:</b> FDM systems may face challenges when accommodating a large number of signals or when there is a need to dynamically allocate bandwidth to different signals.<br><br>
<h2>Conclusion</h2><br>

Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) is a multiplexing technique that combines multiple signals onto a single communication channel by dividing the available frequency range into separate frequency bands. FDM is widely used in radio and television broadcasting, allowing multiple stations or channels to coexist within the shared frequency spectrum.<br> FDM offers simultaneous transmission of signals, interference mitigation, and compatibility with existing systems. However, it also has limitations, such as fixed bandwidth allocation and limited flexibility.
